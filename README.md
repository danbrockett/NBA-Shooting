# NBA-Shooting

As LeBron James approached the once-unbreakable NBA Career Scoring Record held by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, there have been many notable statistics regarding the sheer ability, longevity, and dedication it takes to breaking such a record. Within the data-collection file, there are two unique scraping functions: one to scrape shot location information from NBA.com and the other to retrieve game-by-game box score statistics from basketball-reference.com. This data can then be cleaned and combined into a data frame containing information on any and every shot a player has taken since the NBA began collecting shot location data back in 1997. Although the file is setup to scrape for LeBron, the function can be modified to accomodate any player or other modifications, including regular/postseason.
